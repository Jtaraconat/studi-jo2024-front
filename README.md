This is the frontend for my final evaluation for my bachelor.
It's coded with react and tailwindCss. It features a home page, admin page protected by role, a ticket page where you can find all the tickets available to buy.
Everything is hosted on firebase, the DB is hosted on alwaysData.
For the admin there is a CRUD to handle the tickets.
